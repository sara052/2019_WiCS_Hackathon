# 2019_WiCS_Hackathon

This project so far is a gradebook for CS 2150. Students can enter grades for each assignment and calculate their final grades. It is built with Django, and right now can only run locally. In the future we plan to deploy with Heroku to make it work online. Also we plan to add more features and even make it support multiple other classes in UVA.
